<h3 id="overview-and-longer-course-description">Overview and Longer Course Description</h3>
<p>This is a project-based course that introduces you to reproducible and
collaborative statistical research, applied to real scientific questions.  You
will gain experience acquiring, cleaning, and curating data; formulating
scientific questions statistically; developing appropriate statistical methods
to analyze the data to answer the scientific questions; implementing those
methods in robust, testable, reusable, extensible software; applying the
methods; visualizing the results; interpreting the results; and communicating
the results to others. And you will learn to do this in a way that is
computationally reproducible, which is increasingly recognized as key to
scientific progress.</p>
<p>As if you were working in a scientific research group or in industry, you will
be given a set of tools (a “software stack”) and practices you are required to
master and use. As if you were working in a scientific research group or in
industry, you will be pointed to resources to help you learn the tools, and it
is your responsibility to ensure that you have mastered them, which will
require a substantial amount of time outside class. And, as if you were working
in a scientific research group or in industry, you will be required to
collaborate and to take responsibility for your role in the collaboration. </p>
<p>But the point is not merely to master the tools or to learn to collaborate
effectively.  Rather, the point is to do sound computational science, and to do
it in a way that others can verify the data and statistical techniques behind
your analysis, can verify that your code does what it’s supposed to do, can run
the code using the data and parameters you used, can verify that they get the
same results you do, and can build on what you have done. </p>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>Three hours of class per week in two 90-minute sessions, plus two hours of labwork.
Class sessions are divided between lecture and collaborative work. To a large
extent, the class is “flipped,” meaning that you are responsible for watching
video lectures and working through online tutorial materials—outside class—as
well as collaborating with your team outside class, so that a substantial
amount of class time can be devoted to group work on the project, including
frequent in-class presentations by students, code reviews, brainstorming, etc.
Students are expected to work at least eight hours per week outside class, making
this a 4-unit course (thirteen hours of effort per week).</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>10% quizzes, 20% labs, 30% individual projects, and 40% group project</p>
<p>All work will be done using the version control system Git. The Git repository
is not merely a mechanism for submitting work, but the way you will work with
code and text throughout the course. You will be expected to be a Git
expert by the end of the course.</p>
<p>There will be periodic, short quizzes in class.</p>
<p>The weekly <a href="http://www.jarrodmillman.com/stat159-fall2015/pages/labs.html">labs</a> will focus on the analysis of functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</p>
<p>For the first half of the course, there will be a number of individual projects
to develop the basic computational skills and development habits the students
will need for their final group projects.  The group projects will be the
primary focus for the last half of the semester.  There will be regular
milestones that will involve code submissions, code review, and short
presentations.</p>
<p>For students registered in Stat 159, the final group project will involve fMRI
and will build on the material covered in the weekly labs.  While there will be
a number of regular milestones, the final deliverable for the group project
will involve a poster session and project report.</p>
<p>For students registered in Stat 259, you will need to determine the scientific
question and identify the data sources for your group projects.  The final
deliverable for the group project will involve an oral presentation and project
report.  You will also be assigned to help one of the Stat 159 final project
groups.</p>
<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>Readings will be assigned weekly and will mostly consist of articles and
tutorials.  Examples of the assigned articles are listed below.  Assigned
tutorials will vary per semester, but there will be an emphasis on using
official project documentation.</p>
<h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>
